#### Abstract

**Background:** In the face of the rapid spread of COVID-19 pandemic, predicting the spread of COVID-19 can help healthcare providers prepare and respond to outbreaks more quickly and effectively, ultimately leading to better care for patients. 

**Objective:** We aim to develop a method to detect the early COVID-19 outbreak or identify potential early outbreaks using machine learning by analyzing epidemiological data in Republic of Korea.

**Methods:** Machine learning methods were developed to predict the transmission trend of COVID-19 and proposed a new method to detect the start timing of new outbreaks. We constructed risk index and labeling to measure the change in transmission trend of COVID-19. Additionally, the study used machine learning methods to detect the start timing of new outbreaks based on Label 2, which is maintained for at least 14 days, and predicted Labels to early detect future transmission trends. 

**Results:** Machine learning methods had the high accuracy with more than 90% for estimating the classification of the transmission trend (Increase, Maintain, Decrease). The proposed method not only accurately predicted the start timing of new major outbreaks but also provided a standard for accurately predicting the start timing of minor outbreaks. Random Forest showed the most accurate estimation for outbreak detection.

**Conclusions:** The proposed method can provide an explainable standard for accurately predicting the start timing of both major and minor outbreaks. It can help develop effective prevention and control measures for COVID-19 transmission
